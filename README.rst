Barcode Invoice Renderer
==========================

Test using docker:

Enter container:
        docker exec -it pretix-docker_pretix_1 /bin/bash

in container:
        cp -R /usr/src/pretix-barcode-invoice-renderer/ ~/; export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE= ; pip3 install ~/pretix-barcode-invoice-renderer/

Restart container:
        docker-compose restart pretix


Variant without restarting:
Install package in development mode:
        python setup.py develop --prefix /pretix/.local

Overwrite modified file
        cp /usr/src/pretix-barcode-invoice-renderer/pretix_barcode_invoice_renderer/invoice.py /pretix/pretix-barcode-invoice-renderer/pretix_barcode_invoice_renderer/

Sometimes old file is cached in some runners:
        Kill the gunicorn process in docker (e.g., via htop on host system)
        -> should restart automatically
